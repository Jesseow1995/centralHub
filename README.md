# Central Hub

> Capstone project for Bottega Code School

A central hub to provide easy access to your favorite things, such as a scheduler, up to date news articles, youtube videos, and your own blog.

I have created a second repository to contain the code for the blog backend. It is called centralhubapi. I have also deployed that repository to heroku to allow for full functionality online. This is the link to the api repositor: https://github.com/Jesseow1995/centralhubapi.git

If you want to run this app on your own local host server after cloning this repository you would need to run the npm install command to install all of the node_modules and then run both the commands "node blog-data.js" and "npm start" in different terminals. After that the app should be fully functional locally.
