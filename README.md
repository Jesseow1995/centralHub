# Central Hub

> Capstone project for Bottega Code School

A central hub to provide easy access to your favorite things, such as a scheduler, up to date news articles, youtube videos, and your own blog.

I have created a second repository to contain the code for the blog backend. It is called centralhubapi. I have also deployed that repository to heroku to allow for full functionality online.
